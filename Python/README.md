This folder contains scripts to run the LTA model in Python.

"LTAModel_FullPlotwSubplot.py" runs the LTA model with a static graphical output of the cross-shore barrier profile and a subplot depicting a flux/boundary of choice with time.

"LTAModel_FullPlotwSubplot_Animated.py" does the same, but animates the grahipcal output. An example "BarrierAnimation" GIF is provided.
